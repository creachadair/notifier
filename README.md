# notifier

The noteserver is a program that runs on a local macOS machine and exposes
various useful endpoints via JSON-RPC 2.0. Combined with SSH forwarding, it can
be used to integrate notifications, clipboard, and other useful bits with a
terminal session on a remote system.

Warning: This is by no means a polished product; this is just something I find
useful and have tweaked as needed to make things work.
